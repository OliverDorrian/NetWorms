        <p>
            The studio was filled with the rich odour of roses, and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees
            of the garden, there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac, or the more delicate perfume
            of the pink-flowering thorn.
            From the corner of the divan of Persian saddle-bags on which he was lying, smoking, as was his custom,
            innumerable cigarettes, Lord Henry Wotton could just catch the gleam of the honey-sweet and honey-coloured
            blossoms of a laburnum, whose tremulous branches hardly seemed able to bear the burden of a beauty so
            flamelike as theirs; and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long
            tussore-silk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window, producing a kind of momentary
            Japanese effect, and making him think of those pallid, jade-faced painters of Tokyo who, through the medium
            of an art that is necessarily immobile, seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion. The sullen murmur
            of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass, or circling with monotonous insistence
            round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine, seemed to make the stillness more oppressive.
            The dim roar of London was like the bourbon note of a distant organ.
